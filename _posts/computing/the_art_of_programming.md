> The process of preparing programs for a digital computer is especially attractive because it not only can be economically and scientifically rewarding, it can also be an aesthetic experience much like composing poetry or music.

> Understanding requires thinking, and thinking is hard. In the words of the cartoonist Dick Guindon:
> Writing is nature's way of letting you know how sloppy your thinking is.


> No complex adaptive system will succeed in adapting in a reasonable amount of time unless the adaptation can proceed subsystem by subsystem, each subsystem relatively inde足 pendent of the others.

> The vital point that underlies the following discussion is that the form足 builders in unselfconscious cultures respond to small changes in a way that allows the subsystems of the misfit system to work independently - but that because the selfconscious re足 sponse to change cannot take place subsystem by subsystem, its forms are arbitrary.

> For this reason we shall refer to this special decomposition as the program for the problem represented by G(M,L) . We call it a program because it pro足 vides directions or instructions to the designer, as to which subsets of M are its significant "pieces," and so which major aspects of the problem he should apply himself to. This program is a reorganization of the way the designer thinks
about the problem.
