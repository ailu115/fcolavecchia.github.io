## F# Resources

This is an opinionated list of web resources and books that helped me with F\#. These are books and sites I use frequently, for a more
a complete list of resources, check [the list of the F\# Foundation](https://fsharp.org/learn/) and [the learning resources in Microsoft .NET site](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/fsharp).

### Books

- [Stylish F# 6](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-7205-3) by Kit Eason. Loved the first chapter about the sense of style in programming, and the next chapters follows that spirit.

- [Essential Functional-First F#](https://leanpub.com/essential-fsharp), by Ian Russell. With a big difference from other approaches, this book starts with a full example in F# that is througly discussed, and _then_ presents the elements of the language in the next chapters. 

- [Beginning F# 4.0](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-1374-2), by Robert Pickering and Kit Eason. Just a little outdated (we are now at version 7.0), approaches the language from its different paradigms, from functional to object oriented to imperative programming. 

- [Expert F# 4.0](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-0740-6), by Don Syme, Adam Granicz, Antonio Cisternino. By the very same creator of the language, it also showcases the flexibility of F# to adopt different programming paradigms. The examples are advanced in general, but useful to understand deeply the inner works of F#. 


### Functional Programming with F\#

- [F# for fun and profit](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/), by Scott Wlaschin. One of the most complete references with detailed examples and a profound view of fundamentals. Check also 
Scott's presentations in YouTube.

- [What I wish I knew when learning F#](https://danielbachler.de/2020/12/23/what-i-wish-i-knew-when-learning-fsharp.html), by Daniel Bachler.

### Web Development resources

- [Fable](https://fable.io/), the amazing transpiler from F# to JavaScript (and lately, [other languages](https://fable.io/blog/2022/2022-06-06-Snake_Island_alpha.html). Is not just a compiler, but a way to use these languages together. Depending on the recipe you would like to prepare, add the ingredients at your own pleasure. Also, check [Fable REPL](https://fable.io/repl/), where you can sketch with F#, no installation of anything needed

- [Feliz](https://zaid-ajaj.github.io/Feliz/)  is kind of hard to define, but basically it enables you to build and/or interact with React components directly in F#.

- [Feliz.Bulma](https://dzoukr.github.io/Feliz.Bulma) is a wrapper around the well-known [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) CSS framework, tailored to the [Feliz](https://zaid-ajaj.github.io/Feliz/) DSL. 

- [Html2Feliz](https://thisfunctionaltom.github.io/Html2Feliz/) enables you to translate plain HTML into Feliz.

- [SAFE Stack](https://safe-stack.github.io/docs/) is a full fledged F# framework to build web applications. It takes care of the front end, the backend and even the deployment into the Azure cloud. 


### High performance F\# 

- [Topological sort in F#](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnOx0OGml1t-6u_v2N0GemA) by Matthew Crews. In this fantastic series, Matthews starts with a pure functional version of a topological sort, and squeezes all the (rather advanced to me) features of F\# to speed up the code. 

### Misc stuff

- [What I wish I knew when learning F#](https://danielbachler.de/2020/12/23/what-i-wish-i-knew-when-learning-fsharp.html), by Daniel Bachler. 
- [A nice thread on reusability of binding names](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/9900).
- [Decoupling decisions from effects](https://blog.ploeh.dk/2016/09/26/decoupling-decisions-from-effects/), by Mark Seemann.
- [Dependency Rejection](https://blog.ploeh.dk/2017/02/02/dependency-rejection/), by Mark Seemann.
